---

## 🎯 TESTING OBJECTIVES

1. ✅ Verify JD is NOT saved to database
2. ✅ Verify component matching works correctly
3. ✅ Verify matching visualization displays properly
4. ✅ Verify rating system shows accurate scores
5. ✅ Verify CV generation from matches works
6. ✅ Verify PDF export works correctly

---

## 🚀 SETUP

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment variables** configured in `.env.local`:

**Database Check:**
```sql
-- JD should NOT be in cvs table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cvs WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute';
-- Expected: 0 (or no new rows)

-- JD components should NOT be in components table with src='job_description'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM components WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' AND src = 'job_description' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute';
-- Expected: 0 (or no new rows)
```

2. Test with user having many components (50+)
3. Monitor console for timing

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Matching completes in < 10 seconds
- ✅ UI remains responsive during processing
- ✅ Animations are smooth (60fps)
- ✅ No memory leaks (check Chrome DevTools)
- ✅ PDF generation completes in < 20 seconds

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations:
1. **No JD History:** Since JD is not saved, users cannot view past matches
2. **No Edit Matches:** Users cannot manually adjust match scores
3. **Single PDF Format:** Only accepts PDF files, not text or Word docs
4. **English Only:** Reasoning generation works best with English JDs
5. **LaTeX Dependency:** PDF generation requires LaTeX service availability

### Expected Errors (Not Bugs):
- ⚠️ "No components found" - User has no CV components yet
- ⚠️ "LaTeX compilation failed" - LaTeX online service is down (fallback to local)
- ⚠️ "Rate limit exceeded" - Too many API calls to Gemini (wait 1 minute)

---

## 📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Must Pass:
- ✅ All 10 test cases pass
- ✅ No JD saved to database (verified in SQL)
- ✅ Matching completes in < 10 seconds
- ✅ PDF downloads successfully
- ✅ No console errors during normal flow

### Should Pass:
- ✅ Responsive on all screen sizes
- ✅ Animations are smooth
- ✅ Error messages are helpful
- ✅ Match scores seem reasonable (verified manually)

### Nice to Have:
- ✅ Match reasoning is accurate and helpful
- ✅ Suggestions are actionable
- ✅ UI is intuitive without instructions

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS

### Enable Detailed Logging

In browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'magiccv:*')
```

### Check Network Requests

1. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
2. Look for:
   - `POST /api/jd/match` - should return 200 with results
   - `POST /api/cv/generate-from-matches` - should return PDF blob

### Check Database State

```sql
-- Verify no JD was saved
SELECT * FROM cvs WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check user's existing components
SELECT COUNT(*), type FROM components WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' GROUP BY type;

-- Check if embeddings exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM components WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' AND embedding IS NOT NULL;
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "No matching components found"
- **Cause:** User has no CV components
- **Fix:** Add components via `/library` page

**Issue:** "Matching takes too long"
- **Cause:** Too many components to compare
- **Fix:** Reduce matching limit in service (default: 50)

**Issue:** "PDF generation fails"
- **Cause:** LaTeX service unavailable
- **Fix:** Check LaTeX service logs, ensure online compiler is accessible

**Issue:** "Match scores are all low"
- **Cause:** CV components have different domain than JD
- **Fix:** Expected behavior - user needs more relevant experience
